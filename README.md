# Change Order Payment Gateway

_Just click the edit icon beside "Billing"_ â€“ The functionality of this plugin is mostly already in core. 

When I started to write this, I didn't know that the payment gateway could easily be changed already. I continued to write this because I was learning how to use Backbone.js with WooCommerce. This should serve as simple example of how to use the already available Backbone.js library with WooCommerce.

This simple task; Given a completed order with payment method set to Bank Transfer, add the ability to change the order's payment gateway to Cheque.

## Setup

```
wp wc payment_gateway update bacs --enabled=true
wp wc payment_gateway update cheque --enabled=true

wp wc shop_order create --payment_method=bacs --set_paid=true
```

Gives:

![Order View](./assets/order-view.png "The admin order view for a created order.")

```html
<p class="woocommerce-order-data__meta order_number">
  Payment via Direct bank transfer. Paid on November 24, 2021 @ 9:33 pm
</p>
```

Created in `WC_Meta_Box_Order_Data::output()` ([class-wc-meta-box-order-data.php:196](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/e730f7463c25b50258e97bf56e31e9d7d3bc7ae7/includes/admin/meta-boxes/class-wc-meta-box-order-data.php#L196-L199))

The standard edit icon for Billing and Shipping is addded with:

```html
<a href="#" class="edit_address">Edit</a>
```

## Solution

This plugin first adds the edit icon beside the order's payment gateway details:

![New Edit Icon](./assets/new-edit-icon.png "The first UI for the new functionailty")

This is the existing style of modals on the order edit page:

![Standard WC modal](./assets/standard-wc-backbone-modal.png "Existing modal to replicate")

Using WooCommere's `WCBackboneModal` ([backbone-modal.js](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/5.9.0/assets/js/admin/backbone-modal.js)), which mostly just needs a template and callbacks supplied, I created:
